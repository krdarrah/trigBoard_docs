Factory Programming and Functional Checkout
-------------------------------------------

Every trigBoard is Factory Programmed and tested using automated software:

    <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2em;">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hrNsdTKUbfY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>

That Processing CODE is `here <https://github.com/krdarrah/trigBoardTester>`_


FCC Testing
-------------------------------------------

The trigBoard contains an FCC pre-certified module - (ESP32-WROOM-32D) That certification can be found `here <https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/esp32-wroom-32d_fcc_wi-fi_bt4.0_certificate.pdf>`_ and any of the other certifications can be found `here <https://www.espressif.com/en/support/documents/certificates>`_

The board was still tested for non-intentional radiation and passed with no issues - the board was tested with both a 3V and 2V input:
