Connections
-------------

	.. warning::
		The DC-DC booster modules need to be preset before installation.  The 3.3V pin on the trigBoard is only enabled when triggered, so you can use wire this to the booster module, but **DON'T** connect the output, until you adjust it for 12V using the trimpot.  I did this with the trigBoard and just held the wake button until the LED starts flashing. That will keep the 3.3V rail up while you adjust the booster output.  Then you can disconnect the battery and finish the connections.

Note that the 12V connection is soldered directly to the amplifier board:
