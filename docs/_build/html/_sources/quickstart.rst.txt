| **Hardware Setup** All that's needed here is a battery and a dry contact used for triggering.  Both connectors on the board are standard JST PH 2.0mm
| **Battery Selection** A good capacity for the trigBoard is 500-1000mAh, but this depends on how often the board will be triggered.  Any of these Lithium batteries would work from `Adafruit <https://www.adafruit.com/category/574>`_. Or two AA or AAA batteries would work, with a holder like `This <https://www.adafruit.com/product/4191>`_  Note that this battery holder is also available for purchase with your trigBoard as an option :) More details on battery selection can be found :ref:`here <Battery>`
| **Choose a Notification Service** This is where the notification will end up.  For testing, it's easy to simply use Pushsafer or Pushover - see the :ref:`Supported Services Page <Services>` for more information
