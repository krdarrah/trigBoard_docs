**Get an Email from the trigBoard!**  This is very simple with IFTTT, but you will need to obtain a free maker key - go to the :ref:`Supported Services Page <IFTTT>` to set this up.  Once you have the key, you can proceed with the following steps.  Also note that you can use this as a "backup" notification, so receive a push notification as well as an email.  Just enable any service you want and they'll all fire off at once.  

**Create an Applet**

**This is important - the Event Name must Match the trigBoard Name you give in the Configurator**

**Launch the Configurator and set things up, WiFi, IFTTT enabled and put your Maker Key in, and set the trigBoard name to the Event Name**

**Then test the trigBoard - you should get an Email that looks like this!**

**You can go back into the Applet settings and change how the Email is sent, note that we don't use Value3, so that can be deleted**
